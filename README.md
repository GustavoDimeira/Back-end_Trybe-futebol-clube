<h1>Trybe Football Cluble</h1>
<h3>
  A football leaderboard manegement application.
</h3>
<br/>
<text>
  This aplication was made as a test for the school Trybe, I recive the front-end already done, and have the goal to make all the back-end
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The aplication is capeable to make the entire CRUD of a relacional data-base, and also has a front-end tha allows the user to see all the tables and relateable information together.
  <br/>
  In order to relacionate all the teams and yours respectives games, I used MySQL as data-base, and to have a verry responsive front-end, React was used as frame work.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Configurate all the back-end was a huge challenge, and spend some time defining and thinking aboult all the tables relations was very usefull at the end, and save me alot of time
